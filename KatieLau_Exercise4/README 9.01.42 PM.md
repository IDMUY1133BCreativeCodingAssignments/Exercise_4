# Exercise_4
# Collage and Manipulation

Study chapters P3 & P4 in the Generative Design textbook. Using text and image, create a generative collage. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, generative means **_having the power or function of generating, originating, producing, or reproducing_**.

This collage should change over time, by user input or animation. This collage could be an interactive narrative or stop motion piece that tells a story. Be creative and experimental with this exercise.

It must be done in P5.js. You must use images and you must use text.

It's due Thursday October 15th at 10:00am to this Github Repo which you've cloned. Submit a Pull Request. I expect to see 2 pushes before the turning in the final. Submit pull requests throughout.
