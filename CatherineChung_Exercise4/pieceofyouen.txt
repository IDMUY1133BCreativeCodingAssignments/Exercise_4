Dedicated to you.

Your eyes
are the first mirror of my existence.
I see the reflection of my youth.
I want to be that again for you.
Your twin stars
make the gigantic galaxy
colorless
The river flows
in the place of my sadness.
I want to refill your tears in the eyes where I slept and hid.
During that brief time
when you were my world,
Your two hands
Were the first scales of my life
Measuring the lies and truths of the world
My life’s globe
Your teachings were the feathers on my bony wings
Remember the winter where
Both time and our hands froze?
The snowman we made together…
I want to hear the bells we heard in the cold wind.
The times I held your hands to keep them warm.
Your eyes,
Your hands,
I want to look in your eyes forever and hold your hands
I already want to turn back time.
